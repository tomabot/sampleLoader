you will need these packages for the precision sample dispenser:

	pyserial
	tkinter

// evdev requires all the rest of this stuff:
	python-dev			// these next few if
	python-pip			// your using evdev
	gcc				// ...
	linux-headers-$(uname -r)	// ...

they all can be had with "sudo apt-get install ..."

// and if you're using evdev...
// you will also need to download the gz file
// from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/evdev

	evdev-0.5.0.tar.gz    // or whatever version it's at when you read this

// and set this environment variable:

	export PYTHON_EGG_CACHE=/home/vguser/.python-eggs
